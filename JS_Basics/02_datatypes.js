/*

datatypes - used to identify what kind of the data is store in the variable
==> Primitive datatypes - ( immutable and store single value and store in stack memory )

number - 
string - 
boolean - true or false
null - no value
undefined - value has not been assinged to the variable
symbol - used to store unique values
BigInt - used to store large interger values

==> Non primitive datatypes - ( mutable and can store multi values and store in heap memory)

object - used to store the key values
array - used to store the list of values
function - used to store the code

** Stack **                                     ** Heap **
Follow LIFO                                     It doesn't follow any pattern 
                                                ( memory allocation pattern is not fixed)

used for local variables and                    used for objects and dtat structures last longer
temporary data

store the values in contiguous                  store the values in random manner (It is faster)
